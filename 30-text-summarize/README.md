## Summarize Text Using a Pre-trained Model
A sample Python script to summarize text using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face with TensorFlow.

### Dependencies
1. transformers
2. tensorflow
3. torch
4. tf-keras

### Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Enable virtual environment by running scripts\activate
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. Run the Python script.

### Notes
1. The model t5-small is used here. Depending on the needs, a larger model like t5-base, t5-large, or models from other architectures such as BART (e.g., facebook/bart-large-cnn) can be used.
2. Make sure your environment has enough memory to handle larger models, especially when using them with TensorFlow.
3. This example uses beam search with 'num_beams=4' for better quality summaries. Adjust this parameter or use simpler methods like greedy decoding depending on the performance requirements.
