The idea of Transfer Learning to reuse an already trained mode to do a different/similar task.
We use weights/architecture/training data/parameters of already trained network

1. transfer_learning_mobilenet.py
Use pretrained MobileNetV2 layer to do the transfer learning. Using cifar10 dataset of 10 image types.

2. transfer_learning_mobilenet_2.py
Transfer learning using a different approach using the same network. Using cats and dogs images.

Please note that you may have to run tese codes in Google Colab if any performance issues in your local machine.
