A neural network to recognize digit using Sigmoid activation function.
This code snippet is not using any machine learning libraries.
This was developed by me to learn the SGD and back propogation algorithms and referred Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html
