Digit Recognition with scikit-learn
As part of my learning journey, I am exploring digit recognition using the scikit-learn machine learning library. In my previous attempt, I implemented a sigmoid neural network with quadratic and entropy loss functions, employing Stochastic Gradient Descent and backpropagation. Remarkably, this non-library approach achieved accuracies ranging from 94.5% to 97%.

Transitioning to scikit-learn, I am thrilled to know that even with the basic configuration, the accuracy has surged to an impressive 97.5%. This reinforces the effectiveness and efficiency of utilizing machine learning libraries, showcasing the power of scikit-learn in simplifying and enhancing the digit recognition process.
And the execution is quite fast also.
