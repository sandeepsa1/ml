## Logistic Regression using Machine Learning and Neural Network Libraries
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks.
This repository contains a simple implementation of logistic regression using machine learning approach and also a neural network to classify whether a given iris flower is of the species "Setosa" or not.


1. Using ML approach
logistic_regression_ml.py
This code demonstrates how to implement logistic regression using Python and the popular machine learning library scikit-learn. Using a dataset called the Iris dataset, which is often used for classification tasks. In this example, classification is done on whether a given iris flower is of the species "Setosa" or not based on its features.

2. Using neural network approach
logistic_regression_nn.py
This code demonstrates how to implement logistic regression using neural network library tensorflow. The neural network used in this implementation has a single neuron in the output layer with a sigmoid activation function, which is suitable for binary classification. The Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets is used for this purpose.

### Results
The model outputs the accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, which can be used to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model implemented using both machine learning and neural network.
