Digit Recognition with tensorflow
In this sample code, I am trying to implement the same digit recognition using the neural network library tensorflow. Activation function used is RELU. In my previous attempts, I tried using ML library scikit-learn and also implemented a sigmoid neural network with quadratic and entropy loss functions, employing Stochastic Gradient Descent and backpropagation. ML library approach provided an accuracy of 97.5% and the non-library approach achieved accuracies ranging from 94.5% to 97%.

Transitioning to tensorflow, the accuracy has surged to 98.9% although the execution was a bit slower than using the Machine Learning library

Installation of tensorflow is required
