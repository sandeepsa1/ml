How to integrate perceptrons: When predicting whether a random point in a plane lies within a closed space, like a circle.
The approach involves combining four perceptrons to achieve accurate predictions.
A simple javascript code that predicts if the points are within or outside a random circle.

Idea is to keep the circular space as a set of lines by drawing tangents and perpendiculars to it.
Area coming under these lines are part of the circle. More number of perpendiculars gives a well defined circular space.

This way prediction can be done on any type of non-linear spaces.
